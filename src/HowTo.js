                        <p>Life can get stressful, and a great way to cope with that and destress
                            is to go on walks. A study in Germany showed that mindful walking could reduce stress levels on
                            adults.
                            Going to places can help to brighten oneâ€™s day, but at the same time, we want to ensure that one
                            does
                            not encounter something stressful along the way. Oftentimes, people only
                            know of nice walking paths from experience or word of mouth. To make matters even more complicated,
                            destressing comes in many forms, and different populations have different versions of stress.
                            This is where we come in.</p>
