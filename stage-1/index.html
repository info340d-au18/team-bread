        <h1>Topic Overview</h1>
        <p>
            For our project, we’d like to build a website to plan walking or jogging routes with an emphasis on
            encountering places one would enjoy. Life can get stressful, and a great way to cope with that and destress
            is to go on walks. Going to places can help to brighten one’s day, but at the same time, we want to ensure
            that one does not encounter something stressful along the way. For example, imagine being a UW student
            during finals week trying to destress trying to get to your favorite bakery for a chocolate croissant.
            Google maps tells you the only way to get there is to walk past your regular, study spot. Do you trust
            Google maps or do you decide to walk around the block to avoid that area? Especially during a period where
            time is of the essence, a walking app that helps plans a route ensuring an enjoyable walk while also
            maximizes your time would be a great tool. Map sites like Google Maps are accurate, but their main focus is
            getting you from point A to point B. Route planners for runners do a good job showing potential obstacles
            and road closures, but the main focus is different. Runners care more about distances, interval times,
            elevation and many more. However, there is no way for casual way to plan routes for enjoyment. People only
            know of nice walking paths from experience or word of mouth. Destressing comes in many forms, and for
            different populations they will have different versions of stress. The goal is to find stress points like
            car traffic, noise, or people. A study showed that mindful walking can reduce stress levels on adults

        <h1>Potential Applications</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Local Route Planner</li>
            <li>Find Places to Destress</li>
            <li>Plan Day Trips or Vacations</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Local Route Planner</h3>
        <p>In creating a local route planner, our main goal is to ensure relaxing walks around one’s local area. It
            would allow users to put in a destination, and the app would generate a route that avoids stressful places
            (ie: study spots at school) and brings them to stress-free places in their local area. Users would take a
            survey to figure out what they deem stressful, and the application would adjust accordingly. Additionally,
            the emphasis on one’s local area means that even in an environment that one is very comfortable, this app
            would allow them to explore and find enjoyment that is close to them.
        </p>
        <h3>Find Places to Destress</h3>
        <p>For this application, the goal is for people to explore their surrounding area and find new places to
            destress. They will likely use the application during their lunch breaks at work or after a long day of
            class. After a long few hours of work, walking around and changing the pace of one’s environment can help
            refresh and energize people to finish their day strong. Based on the user’s input on what places they like
            to go to, the app will generate some nearby places for the user to pick and visit. The goal is to find a
            comforting place in one’s surrounding area to explore within walking distance of their current location.
            Once they find and visit the place they can rate the areas based on stress levels. The rating system will be
            a short survey we provide that could ask the user about how noisy or busy the place was for future users.
            The users can filter out locations based on distance, category, and stress factors. This way the application
            can provide a list of the most relevant places the user would prefer.
        </p>
        <h3>Plan Day Trips of Vacations</h3>
        <p>This application allows users to plan walking or hiking routes in farther destinations, so they can enjoy a
            day trip to Vancouver, Canada or plan their days on a European vacation. Some people/families enjoy roaming
            around a foreign city, exploring local foods, and visiting attractions. Or for some who want a local walking
            spot to complete on the weekend, they can also find places within a certain driving distance. Users can
            input the distance they would be willing to walk, types of places they would like to see, and the typical
            pedestrian traffic level. Users would search the city they are planning to walk around in and input the
            above factors to find the ideal places for them.
